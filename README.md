# Nastroje-pro-vyvoj-software
I chose these 6 tasks to be solved // TODO 1 more + 1 extra Kubernetes
## 02-Git
This assignment is completed from previous year so it's just copy-pasted from back then. Solution is called **reseni.txt**. 
## 03-Make
Solved this year, there are 2 Makefiles (one **root folder**, second **mydb/src**) that are working together with all requirements met.  
## 05-Build/CMake
CMakeLists.txt root, and project folder. 
## 08-Testing/JUnit
Testing was tried on Java/JUnit and result are in separate public repo along w/ code and additional information: [KlosStepan/UnitTesting-JUnit](https://github.com/KlosStepan/UnitTesting-JUnit).
## 09-Doxygen
Last assignment that was chosen was automatic generation of documentation. It's for my custom project [KlosStepan/SwimmPair-Www](https://github.com/KlosStepan/SwimmPair-Www) in PHP, so it's a bit different from what we've talked about on the lesson, however, all requirements were met as well. The documentation is running in my K8s Cluster on address [docu.swimmpair.cz](http://docu.swimmpair.cz).
## 00-Kubernetes/Docker
I set up my DOKS-Kubernetes and migrated several LAMP applications over there. I worked with multiple nodes, chose appropriate images for situations and set up my own database with persistent volume.
